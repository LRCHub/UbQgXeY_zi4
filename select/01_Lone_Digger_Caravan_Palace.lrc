[00:39.14] You feel the rhythm going
[00:41.54] (They call it lonely diggin')
[00:56.04] 
[00:43.02] Legs ain't got time to lay low
[00:45.37] Your knees are bending, so
[00:47.48] It's time to get up and let go
[00:49.20] (You're gonna come undone)
[01:02.20] 
[00:50.74] Hey Mama, how is it going?

[01:17.73] 
[01:05.80] Baby, can you move around the rhythm
[01:07.14] So we can get with 'em
[01:07.91] Jump around, and get us a rock'n roll 'round
[01:09.92] Just a downtown body-body
[01:11.03] Comin' with a super hotty
[01:12.24] Let's go, real slow, hell no
[01:26.24] 
[01:13.54] Baby, can you move around the rhythm
[01:14.81] 'Cause you know we're all livin' in the fast lane
[01:16.36] Speed up, it ain't no game
[01:17.68] Just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
[01:44.68] 
[01:36.96] Hey brother, what you thinkin'?
[01:39.39] That good ol' sound is ringin'
